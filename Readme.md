This example illustrates how to implement the master-detail GridView with editing capabilities.

Follow the steps below to define the master-detail layout:

1. Define master and detail GridView settings in separate PartialView files.

    GridViewMasterPartial.cshtml
    ```cshtml
    @Html.DevExpress().GridView(
        settings => {
            settings.Name = "masterGrid";
            // ...
        }).Bind(Model).GetHtml()
    ```
    GridViewDetailPartial.cshtml
    ```cshtml
    
    @Html.DevExpress().GridView(
        settings => {
            settings.Name = "detailGridView_" + ViewData["RoomID"];
            // ...
    }).Bind(Model).GetHtml()
    ```
2. Set the master grid's [SettingsDetail.ShowDetailRow](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetMvc/DevExpress.Web.Mvc.MVCxGridViewDetailSettings._members) property to `true`.

    ```cshtml
    settings.SettingsDetail.ShowDetailRow = true;
    ```
3. Call the master grid's [SetDetailRowTemplateContent](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetMvc/DevExpress.Web.Mvc.GridViewSettings.SetDetailRowTemplateContent.overloads) method to render the detail grid's PartialView in the [Detail Row](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetMvc/16880/components/grid-view/visual-elements/detail-row).

    ```cshtml
    settings.SetDetailRowTemplateContent(c => {
        Html.RenderAction("GridViewDetailPartial", new { RoomID = DataBinder.Eval(c.DataItem, "ID") });
    });
    ```

Note that route valuesÂ passedÂ in a detail grid's callback must have a unique name and must not replicate any other names on a page.
